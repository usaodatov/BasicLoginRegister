This C# application represents a basic login and registration system implemented as a Windows Forms application. The core functionality includes user authentication, navigation between forms, and error handling. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code:

Key Features
User Authentication:

Users input their credentials (username and password) into text fields.
Credentials are validated by comparing them with data stored in a file.
The file is retrieved using the GetCredentialsFilePath method (defined in CommonMethods.cs).
Each line in the file represents a user, with details stored in a comma-separated format: Name,Surname,Username,Password.
Registration Form:

Clicking the "New Register" button opens the Registration form, where new users can register their details.
The Registration form is displayed using ShowDialog().
Successful Login:

On successful authentication:
The Profile form is displayed, initialized with the user's name, surname, and email (parsed from the file).
The current Access form is hidden while the Profile form is active and shown again after the Profile form is closed.
Error Handling:

Handles potential exceptions, such as file access issues, and displays error messages in a user-friendly manner using MessageBox.
Clearing Text Fields:

After each login attempt, the username and password fields are cleared using the ClearLoginForm() method.
Event Handlers for Form Navigation:

Logic is included for handling text changes in the username and password fields (currently placeholders for additional logic).
The ProfileForm_FormClosed event ensures the login form is displayed again when the profile form is closed.
File Structure and Dependencies
Credentials File:

Stores user details in the following format:
Copy code
Name,Surname,Username,Password
The file path is retrieved using CommonMethods.GetCredentialsFilePath().
Additional Forms:

Registration Form (Registration): A separate form for user registration.
Profile Form (Profile): Displays the userâ€™s profile after a successful login, initialized with user data.
UI Components:

Text Fields:
txtUsername for entering the username.
txtPassword for entering the password.
Buttons:
NewRegister to open the registration form.
LogIn to authenticate the user.
Core Functionalities
1. Login Flow
Input:
Users input their username and password in the txtUsername and txtPassword fields.
Validation:
The entered credentials are checked against the data in the credentials file.
If a match is found, the user is redirected to their profile.
If no match is found, an error message is displayed.
Post-Processing:
After each attempt (successful or not), the fields are cleared using ClearLoginForm().
2. Registration Flow
Action:
Clicking the NewRegister button opens the Registration form using ShowDialog().
Purpose:
Allows new users to input and save their details in the credentials file.
3. Navigation
Access Form:
Acts as the main form for logging in or accessing the registration form.
Profile Form:
Displays user details after a successful login.
The Access form is hidden while the Profile form is open and reappears after it is closed.
4. Error Handling
File-Related Issues:
If the credentials file cannot be read or accessed, an error message is displayed.
Login Failures:
If credentials are invalid, the user receives a message prompting them to check their input.
Future Enhancements
Password Hashing:
Use secure password hashing (e.g., BCrypt) instead of plain-text passwords.
Database Integration:
Replace the file-based storage with a database (e.g., SQL Server or SQLite) for better scalability and security.
User-Friendly Features:
Add "Forgot Password?" functionality.
Enhance UI with input validation and feedback during typing.
Session Management:
Add session logic to persist the user's state after logging in.
Summary
This application serves as a foundational example of a basic login and registration system using Windows Forms in C#. The code demonstrates fundamental concepts like:

Form navigation and lifecycle management.
File-based user authentication.
Error handling for robustness.
